# PREFACE

This project is a temporal solution to the lack of connectivity between Wirecloud GE and Cosmos for those folks willing to retrieve historical data on widgets.

It consist on two modules, a server-side (i.e., Bifrost) which aims is to retrieve data base on WebHDFS calls, and a client-side (i.e., Bifrost) which goal is to display HDFS data in NGSI format.
