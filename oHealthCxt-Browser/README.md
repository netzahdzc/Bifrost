The oHealthCxt-Browser is a complementary part of an extension to connect Widgets with Cosmos 
in order to display historical data over mashups.
It is improtant to make clear, that this implementation is an extension of an Orion Context browser 
already implemented at the time this extension was built. The reference resource is available at [Orion Context
Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker).

> Moreover, is whorthy mentioning that this is a working progress extension, that will be updated on gitHub
